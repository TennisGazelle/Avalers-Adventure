### Simulator
#### Installation
Requires python, python-tk, and python library 'MatPlotLib' which can be installed by typing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python python-tk python-matplotlib
```

### Running
To run as a program:

```bash
cd Simulator/
python numGen.py
```

This runs on a set numberof iterations, but this will be modified to run indefinitely, and to use keyboard input for waveform modification. Network testing is still to be implemented.
See content of `numGen.py` for data script details.

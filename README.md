# Avalar's Adventure

## **Description**
Although generally overlooked as a normal bodily function, the ability to swallow is quite important for the human experience; it enables eating, drinking, and salivating. However, there are people whose ability to swallow is impeded due to an accident, illness, or predisposed swallowing disorder. For patients undergoing Speech Pathology Therapy, there are many exercises designed to train and strengthen muscles and tendons. To aid in this therapy, games visually report feedback received from electrical signals from a sensor attached to the patientâ€™s throat. The team is creating a game suite that is well suited for various patient demographics. The team has prototyped several of the features of the suite. These features will be tested against several acceptance criteria and this document intends to detail the testing strategy and plan. This project aims to create a game suite that uses these signals to play in order to improve the therapy experience for both the patient and the therapist.
